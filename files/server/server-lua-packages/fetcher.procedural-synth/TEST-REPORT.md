# Local validation report — October 15–16, 2026 (America/Chicago)

The prototype builds and passes its automated checks. Two real compatible clients were exercised against a local dedicated server with only Morrowind.esm, Tribunal.esm and Bloodmoon.esm. No production host was contacted or modified.

## Commands and results

Commands run from `C:\serena_workspaces_directory\openmw`:

```powershell
cmake --build MSVC2022_64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target openmw --parallel 3
cmake --build MSVC2022_64 --config RelWithDebInfo --target openmw-server --parallel 3
cmake -S scripts/procedural-synth-tests -B build/synth-core-tests -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=
cmake --build build/synth-core-tests --config Release

lua scripts/test_consuming_animated_relay.lua
git diff --check
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup-procedural-synth-test.ps1 -LiveProbe
```

Both application targets: **PASS**. Existing compiler warnings in other multiplayer code remain; no compiler errors in the final build. A first build exposed an incorrect RefData deletion accessor; it was corrected to the CellRef count check and rebuilt successfully.

CTest: **1/1 PASS**. The standalone DSP executable checks idle silence, finite bounded PCM, NaN/infinity/control/note validation, A4 frequency, continuous sustain, live low-pass response, release to silence, every waveform, both oscillators, 16-note chords, bounded stealing, panic, queue overflow, shutdown and concurrent audio/control activity. A 16-voice dual-triangle run generated two seconds of PCM in approximately **0.24 seconds** on this Windows machine (a microbenchmark, not full-game profiling).

Server Lua: **9 tests / 62 assertions PASS**. These cover format/defaults, schema parity, exclusive ownership, authoritative object/distance checks, authentication and session epochs, sequence rejection, eligible recipients, malformed/oversized/nonfinite fields, rate limits, safety releases, all preset storage operations, stable IDs, namespace isolation, future-version preservation, module reload persistence, disconnect, timeout, cell change, object removal and late snapshots without historical notes.

Client/editor Lua harness: **196 assertions PASS**. It executes the actual editor and player scripts with mocked engine/UI bindings, including all 26 editable controls, optimistic chords, parameter coalescing, preset application, stale events, editor/native cleanup, listener playback, cell change, liveness expiry, mouse-position velocity and mouse release outside the key. This does not substitute for visual inspection or physical keyboard/mouse testing.

Existing consuming-animation relay regression: **14 tests / 63 assertions PASS**. Whitespace check: **PASS**.

The empty toolchain override on standalone test configuration avoids an unrelated stale `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` environment setting pointing at `C:/tes3mp52/...`; the engine uses its existing configured build directory.

## Actual two-client run

Fixture: `C:\serena_workspaces_directory\fetcher-simulator\test-server\procedural-synth`, local UDP 25567. Launches use the copied current PowerShell launcher through the fixture batch wrappers. The fixture database contains only its test identity and vanilla Synth A/B characters; original local profiles and data are preserved. The dedicated server places and synchronizes one dynamic lute-model activator without a client ESP or downloaded asset.

Observed from the actual clients and native audio status:

* Both clients authenticated, received the server Lua package and runtime activator, and entered ToddTest.
* Synth A invoked the actual activator's Lua activation path and opened the editor. The live script then used the editor's own callback/interface path.
* Three simultaneous C-major notes produced **three native voices and nonzero PCM peaks on both clients**. Player B's source is a normal mono 3D OpenAL stream attached to the activator reference.
* In the first successful run A logged playing at **22:09:58.099** and B logged all three relayed note-ons at **22:09:58.132**: approximately **33 ms from local play action to remote event receipt** in that run. This is not a measured speaker-onset latency or a general network guarantee. OpenAL additionally queues approximately 30 ms of interactive audio.
* Live waveform and cutoff changes were relayed while the chord remained active. Later runs logged the remote native instance's updated cutoff/wave state, as well as its nonzero generated output.
* Releasing the notes returned both clients to **zero voices / zero PCM peak**. Closing removed the session; reopening reacquired it and played a new note.
* A saved `Integration Tone` as `p:1`, loaded Soft Pad, then loaded `p:1`; both clients received cutoff **1234** for the saved tone.
* The SQLite character-storage namespace contained the saved library immediately. After a real server restart and both clients reconnecting, A's initial catalog still contained it, and `p:1` loaded with cutoff 1234. The activator count remained **one** across restarts. B's personal catalog did not contain A's presets.
* While A held note 76, its process was terminated abruptly. B received cleanup, acquired the now-free activator and played/released a note. It logged **PASS acquired after abrupt owner disconnect** and **PASS observer takeover complete**. No indefinitely held native voice or permanent lock remained.
* A further run delayed B's launch by 40 seconds (`-SecondClientDelaySeconds 40`), until A was already sustaining a note. B logged **initial listener snapshot voices=0 receivedNotes=0**, while A reported one sustained voice and nonzero PCM. Current parameters were received without replaying the older note-on.

Local logs are retained under the fixture's `evidence/run1`, `evidence/run2` and `evidence/late-join` directories, plus the per-character profile logs and server logs. Generated databases, authentication keys, binaries and live logs are not committed.

Early fixture failures (missing defaults.bin, prefixed interior names and an incomplete mesh path) were corrected in the reusable setup before these successful runs. The setup now uses resources and defaults from the same build as its executables.

## Remaining acceptance work and limitations

* Final speaker output, perceptual timbre/click/dropout quality, stereo positioning and walking-distance attenuation still need a person to listen and move the observer. Nonzero generated PCM and an attached 3D OpenAL source establish the engine path, not those perceptual outcomes.
* No native UI screenshot/visual inspection was available in this session. The real editor created and operated without Lua errors; mouse/keyboard usability, layout at multiple resolutions, focus changes and operating-system focus loss still need interactive QA. Intended minimum layout is approximately 964×719 including margins. Sliders use numeric feedback; the waveform graph is a theoretical oscillator preview rather than a captured output waveform.
* Cell changes, malformed events, overlapping sessions and timeout cleanup were covered in the harness. Not all were repeated by walking/operating real clients. Sound device teardown is covered by native close/concurrency tests and ownership code review, not a physical audio-device hot-unplug test.
* Full game CPU/frame-time profiling, several simultaneous synth instances, packet-loss/jitter tests and prolonged listening remain outstanding. The microbenchmark and the exercised chord do not establish these performance goals.
* The original October 15 run used the vanilla lute. The Casio keyboard import and verified local installation were completed October 16, as recorded below.
* Listener snapshots intentionally omit already-held notes; listeners hear subsequent live note-ons. Native/session state is transient, while personal preset libraries are durable. The first prototype has no public preset sharing, sequencer, MIDI import, Bardcraft port or external synthesizer dependency.

The delivered fixture is switched back to interactive use without the automated probe after validation. Production feature activation stays disabled by default.

## Keyboard asset integration — October 16

The user supplied `keyboard-casio-vl-tone.zip`. Its SHA-256 is
`61cac05a2dd8e7434beb0946a68d1d737210870ea08309300597056cb2564715`.
The official public Sketchfab model API confirmed AleixoAlonso as author and the
exact CC BY 4.0 license URI. Source metadata, author credit, license links and
adaptation details accompany the converted bundle. Original FBX/Blend files remain
outside the repository.

Blender 4.5.3 with `io_scene_mw` exported Morrowind NIF 4.0.0.2, then reimported the
serialized NIF successfully. The model retains 6,896 visual triangles and separate
keys/buttons, plus 12 box-collision triangles. Verified dimensions are approximately
48 × 12.04 × 5.07 game units. Two materials use a 2K DXT1 atlas and approximate LCD
glass; an optional 1K DXT5 normal map is included. Both DDS files have mipmaps.
The rendered reimport was visually inspected for texture resolution, geometry and
orientation. This is an asset preview, not an in-game screenshot. The keys remain
static geometry.

`package_assets.py` passed NIF/DDS header and manifest checks and produced an
818,793-byte ZIP. Setup verified all seven manifested files before and after
installing them into the shared local client/server data directory. A separate
`-VanillaSynth` setup run confirmed that the fallback removes the custom model/data
configuration; the following default setup restored the keyboard.

An actual dedicated-server restart updated the persistent activator's model to
`meshes/fetcher/synth/keyboard.nif`. A read-only SQLite query confirmed that path in
`world_dynamic_records` and exactly one placed synth in `world_objects`. Both real
clients authenticated, entered ToddTest and ran the existing live probe with the
new assets installed. Synth A opened the editor at 15:14:59, both clients produced
three native voices and nonzero PCM, live waveform/cutoff edits propagated, and
the save/load/close/reacquire sequence completed. After A was terminated while
holding a note, B logged `PASS acquired after abrupt owner disconnect` at 15:15:47
and `PASS observer takeover complete` at 15:15:48. Client logs contained no missing
mesh/texture or Lua failure reports during this run. Live visual positioning and
physical mouse-target/collision behavior still need interactive inspection.

CTest 1/1, server Lua 9 tests/62 assertions, client Lua 196 assertions, and existing
relay regression 14 tests/63 assertions were rerun and passed. Python conversion
helpers parsed successfully; whitespace validation passed. Evidence is retained
locally under the fixture's `evidence/keyboard` directory. Setup was returned to
interactive use without the probe. The same fixture batch launchers now use the
keyboard by default; no production configuration was changed.
